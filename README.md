# PLC-Programming-using-OpenPLC
The OpenPLC Project consists of three parts: Runtime, Editor and HMI Builder. The runtime should be installed on your device and is responsible for executing your PLC program. The Editor is the software that runs on your computer and is used to create your PLC programs. Finally, ScadaBR is the HMI Builder. With ScadaBR you can create beautiful web-based animations that will reflect the state of your process. ScadaBR communicates with OpenPLC Runtime over Modbus/TCP.
